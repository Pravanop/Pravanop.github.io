**"If my mind can conceive it and my heart can believe it, then I can achieve it."- Muhammad Ali.**
<div align="justify"> I'm a B.Tech junior currently studying in the National Institute of Technology, Karnataka, Surathkal pursuing a Major in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and a Minor in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My main interests lie in Computational Material Science, Machine Learning and 2-D materials. I am keenly interested in integrating my interests to engineer products that can impact the world. I am also passionate about photography, writing, debating, cricket and volleyball. I frequently write articles voicing my opinions, in my blog. I believe that it is my generation's responsibility now to build a better world for the future and I am always looking to build plausible solutions for pre-existing problems aching our society. My key focus areas are materials for renewable energy, Artificial Intelligence and security. Specifically, I am very interested in Graph based machine learning for characterization of materials, first principle based computational methods for devising structure-property relationships in materials especially in nanomaterials. I have keenly studied nanomaterials based electronics, machine learning based material science and real world applications in AI. </div>
