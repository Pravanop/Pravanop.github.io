# Computational Materials Science
-------
### XRD analysis using interpretable CNN models
<i>Jan 2021 - Present </i><br>
* Currently working on simulating XRD patterns for a specific quatenary compositional pool.
* Building an interpretable CNN model for phase classification in complex multiphase mixtures. 
* Project done under Prof. Mohammad Rizawanur Rahman, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, NITK, Surathkal.

### A Machine Learning based bandgap predictor for varied perovskite crystals
<i>August 2020 - March 2021 </i> <br>
* Journal paper under review. 
* A large dataset has been collated for bandgap prediction of perovskites.
* An existing GNN model has been trained on this dataset and experiments have been made to interpret the model. 
* A pipeline has been created that makes prediction of bandgaps for perovskites easier. This facilitates researchers who want to shortlist compounds for experimental purposes without getting into the specifics of DFT and Machine Learning.

### Predicting corrosion characteristics using AI
<i>May 2020 - November 2020 </i> <br>
* Developed a CNN model to predict important corrosion characteristics from Scanning Electron Microscope images of specimens.
* Code: <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zAzKWPhsqWZlkcN5exvPhjqgNf4Vc5m6?usp=sharing>
* Project under Prof. Shashibhushan Arya, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, NITK, Surathkal.

# Machine Learning/ Artificial Intelligence
-----
### Extensions on Temporal Graph Networks
<i>January 2020 - Present </i><br>
* Experimenting with add-ons to the TGN framework.
* Applying TGN to different datasets in various new applications, and assessing its capabilities.

### RainCheck
<i>August 2019 - Present </i> <br>
* 6th best idea in India and 33rd in the world for the Redbull Basement Challenge 2020.
* Built an LSTM model trained on weather data so as to predict rainfall using only data collected from sensors for local premises. Attained an accuracy of 85 \% in predicting rainfall on Australian weather dataset. 
* Idea Presentation : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0BYH1Sm0K4> 
* Code : <https://github.com/Pravanop/WRAPS>

### AuthNet
<i>August 2019 - April 2020 </i> <br>
* Finalist paper in AAA-21 Student Abstract and Poster Program.
* It was built using the publicly available MIRACL-VC1 dataset with an accuracy of 98.1%.
* Longer version of the paper can be found on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02515)
* Code : <https://github.com/Mohit-Mithra/AuthNet>

### Intelligent and Rather Intuitive Natural Assistant (I.R.I.N.A)
<i>March 2020 - June 2020</i><br>
* Helped in designing the frontend of the app built using flutter.
* Built APIs for various services on the app that are required for a personal assistant like web scraping, object detection, text detection, news retrieval etc. using NLP, Computer Vision and Machine Learning Techniques.
* Code: <https://github.com/SandeshRangreji/Irina_app>

### Mortgage Approval using Machine Learning
<i> February 2020 - April 2020 </i> <br>
* Used Xgboost algorithm to predict approval of mortgages on a real world dataset and obtained an accuracy of 80%.
* Code: <https://github.com/rakki-18/mortgage-classifier>
