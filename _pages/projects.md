### RainCheck
<i>August 2019 - Present </i> <br>
* 6th best idea in India and 33rd in the world for the Redbull Basement Challenge 2020.
* Built an LSTM model trained on weather data so as to predict rainfall using only data collected from sensors for local premises. Attained an accuracy of 85 \% in predicting rainfall on Australian weather dataset. 
* Idea Presentation : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0BYH1Sm0K4> 
* Code : <https://github.com/Pravanop/WRAPS>

### Intelligent and Rather Intuitive Natural Assistant (I.R.I.N.A)
<i>March 2020 - June 2020</i><br>
